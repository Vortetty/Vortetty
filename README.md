# Hey, i'm Kali!

Just a trans girl programming for fun in my free time

## A bit more about me

```python
class basicPronoun():
    def __init__(self, sub, obj):
        self.subjective = sub
        self.objective = obj

kali = {
    "pronouns": [
        basicPronoun("it", "its"),
        basicPronoun("she", "her"),
        basicPronoun("they", "them"),
    ],
    "names": [ "Kali", "Winter", "Tæmt modʒiɹæ", "Vortetty" ],
    "languages": {
        "natural": [ "english" ],
        "computer": [ "python", "c++", "kotlin", "java", "javascript", "c#", "html", "css", "rust" ]
    },
    "current_focus": "Random projects for fun",
    "fun_fact": "Knowing what to search is half of the battle"
}
```

## Why so sparse on repos?

I've started pruning it semi-regularly. Anything i don't feel represents me and does not contribute to the overall open source community is privated; things like merged forks, unused forks, or obsolete projects from my early early learning or school where other resources do better and/or may show bad practice. In a way like taking dead limbs off a tree for safety.
